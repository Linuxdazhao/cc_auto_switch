# Task: Implement j/k key navigation in interactive selection

## Description
Add support for j and k keys for navigation in the alias selection interface. The j key should move the selection down and the k key should move the selection up, following vim conventions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] j key moves selection down by one item
- [ ] k key moves selection up by one item
- [ ] Keys work in the interactive alias selection interface
- [ ] Existing arrow key navigation still works
- [ ] Edge cases handled (e.g., pressing j at bottom, k at top)

## Technical Details
- Modify the keyboard event handling in `src/cmd/interactive.rs`
- Add cases for 'j' and 'k' keys in the event processing logic
- Ensure the selection index is properly updated and bounds-checked
- Integrate with existing selection management logic

## Dependencies
- [ ] Understanding of existing interactive selection implementation

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 2-3
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Deployed to staging
