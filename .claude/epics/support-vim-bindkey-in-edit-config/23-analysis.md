# Analysis for Task #23: Remap q key for exit functionality

## Current Implementation
The interactive selection currently uses `e` key for exit:
- `KeyCode::Char('e')` or `KeyCode::Char('E')` to exit the interface

## Required Changes
1. Change exit key from `e` to `q`
2. Update help text to reflect new keybinding

## Implementation Location
File: `src/cmd/interactive.rs`
Function: `handle_full_interactive_menu`
Location: Around lines 638-643 where `e`/`E` key handling is implemented

## Implementation Plan
1. In the key event match block, change `KeyCode::Char('e')` | `KeyCode::Char('E')` to `KeyCode::Char('q')` | `KeyCode::Char('Q')`
2. Update help text on line 439 and 449 to show `Q` instead of `E` for exit
3. Update simple menu fallback functions to use `q` instead of `e`

## Test Considerations
- Ensure `q`/`Q` keys work for exit
- Verify that `e`/`E` no longer triggers exit functionality
- Test that exit functionality works as expected
- Verify help text shows correct keybinding
