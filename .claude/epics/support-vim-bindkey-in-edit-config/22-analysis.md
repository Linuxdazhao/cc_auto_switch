# Analysis for Task #22: Remap e key for edit functionality

## Current Implementation
The interactive selection currently uses `u` key for editing:
- `KeyCode::Char('u')` or `KeyCode::Char('U')` to edit selected configuration

## Required Changes
1. Change edit key from `u` to `e`
2. Update help text to reflect new keybinding

## Implementation Location
File: `src/cmd/interactive.rs`
Function: `handle_full_interactive_menu`
Location: Around lines 626-636 where `u`/`U` key handling is implemented

## Implementation Plan
1. In the key event match block, change `KeyCode::Char('u')` | `KeyCode::Char('U')` to `KeyCode::Char('e')` | `KeyCode::Char('E')`
2. Update help text on line 439 and 449 to show `E` instead of `U` for editing
3. Update simple menu fallback functions to use `e` instead of `u`

## Test Considerations
- Ensure `e`/`E` keys work for editing
- Verify that `u`/`U` no longer triggers edit functionality
- Test that edit functionality works as expected
- Verify help text shows correct keybinding
