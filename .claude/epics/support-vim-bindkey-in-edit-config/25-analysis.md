# Analysis for Task #25: Cross-platform testing and validation

## Current Implementation
The interactive selection has been implemented with crossterm for cross-platform terminal compatibility.

## Required Changes
1. Test all new keybindings on different platforms
2. Verify performance requirements
3. Run existing test suite

## Implementation Plan
1. Test j/k navigation on all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
2. Test e key edit functionality on all platforms
3. Test q key exit functionality on all platforms
4. Verify performance meets <50ms response time requirement
5. Run existing test suite to ensure no regressions

## Test Considerations
- Platform-specific terminal behavior
- Keyboard event handling differences
- Performance testing with timing measurements
- Existing unit and integration tests
- Edge cases and error handling
