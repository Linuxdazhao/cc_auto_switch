# Stream A Progress Update - Issue #23

## Task Completed
Successfully remapped the 'q' key for exit functionality in the interactive interface.

## Changes Made
1. Updated the display text for the exit option in the interactive menu from "[E]" to "[Q]" to match the actual keybinding
2. Verified that the 'q' key was already implemented for exit functionality
3. Confirmed that all help text correctly shows "Q-退出" for exit functionality
4. Ran tests to ensure no regressions were introduced

## Implementation Details
The 'q' key was already implemented for exit functionality in the code (lines 638-643 in src/cmd/interactive.rs), but the display text was still showing "[E]" for the exit option. The fix was to update the display text to show "[Q]" instead, making the interface consistent with the actual keybinding.

All help text in both single-page and multi-page menus already correctly showed "Q-退出", so no changes were needed there.

## Testing
- Ran pagination tests - all passed
- Ran interactive tests - all passed
- No regressions introduced

## Next Steps
The task is complete and ready for review. The implementation follows vim conventions where 'q' is commonly used for quitting/exiting.
