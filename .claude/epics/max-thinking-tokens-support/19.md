# Task: Implement Comprehensive Test Coverage

## Description

Create comprehensive test coverage for all thinking tokens functionality including unit tests for configuration serialization, CLI parsing, environment variable management, and integration tests for end-to-end workflows. Follow existing test patterns and ensure no regression in existing functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Unit tests for Configuration struct serialization/deserialization
- [ ] CLI argument parsing tests for --max-thinking-tokens flag
- [ ] Environment variable management tests
- [ ] Interactive UI display tests
- [ ] Input validation and error handling tests
- [ ] Integration tests for complete add/switch workflows
- [ ] Backward compatibility tests with existing configurations
- [ ] Edge case testing (boundary values, error conditions)
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass

## Technical Details

**Implementation Approach:**
- Add tests to existing test modules in `src/cmd/tests.rs`
- Create specific test cases for thinking tokens functionality
- Test serialization with and without thinking tokens
- Verify environment variable setting/removal behavior
- Test CLI parsing with various input scenarios

**Code Locations:**
- `src/cmd/tests.rs`: Core functionality tests
- `src/cmd/error_handling_tests.rs`: Error condition tests
- `src/cmd/integration_tests.rs`: End-to-end workflow tests

**Key Considerations:**
- Follow existing test naming and organization patterns
- Use temporary files/directories for configuration tests
- Mock environment variable operations where appropriate
- Test both success and failure scenarios comprehensively

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 001: Configuration struct implementation
- [ ] Task 002: CLI argument implementation
- [ ] Task 003: Environment variable implementation
- [ ] Task 004: Interactive UI implementation
- [ ] Task 005: Validation implementation

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: L
- **Hours**: 3-4 hours
- **Parallel**: false (requires all implementation tasks complete)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All new functionality covered by tests
- [ ] Test coverage includes success and error scenarios
- [ ] Integration tests verify end-to-end workflows
- [ ] Backward compatibility verified through testing
- [ ] All tests pass consistently
- [ ] Test code follows existing patterns and style
- [ ] No regression in existing test suite
- [ ] Tests provide good debugging information on failure
