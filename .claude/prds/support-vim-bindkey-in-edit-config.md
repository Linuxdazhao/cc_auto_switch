# PRD: support-vim-bindkey-in-edit-config

## Executive Summary
This PRD outlines the requirements for implementing vim-style keybindings (j/k for navigation, e for edit, q for exit) in the alias selection interface, improving productivity for users familiar with vim navigation patterns.

## Problem Statement
Users who are accustomed to vim-style keybindings find the current alias selection interface inefficient. The lack of vim navigation shortcuts (j/k for up/down) and vim-standard edit/exit commands (e/q) creates friction for power users and reduces productivity when switching between configurations.

## User Stories
### Primary User Personas
1. **Power User**: Experienced developer comfortable with vim keybindings who wants efficient navigation
2. **System Administrator**: IT professional managing multiple configurations who values speed and efficiency
3. **Developer**: Software engineer who uses vim regularly and expects consistent keyboard navigation

### Detailed User Journeys
1. As a power user, I want to navigate between configuration aliases using j/k keys so that I can move quickly without using arrow keys
2. As a system administrator, I want to edit the selected alias using the 'e' key so that I can follow vim conventions
3. As a developer, I want to exit the interface using the 'q' key so that I can maintain consistent vim-style workflow

### Pain Points
- Inefficient navigation requiring arrow keys
- Inconsistent user experience for vim users
- Slower configuration selection process
- Non-standard edit and exit keybindings

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
1. Implement j key for moving down in alias selection
2. Implement k key for moving up in alias selection
3. Implement e key for editing the selected alias (previously 'u')
4. Implement q key for exiting the interface (previously 'e')
5. Maintain existing navigation methods (arrow keys, enter, etc.)
6. Only apply to interactive alias selection interface

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. Performance: Keybindings should respond within 50ms
2. Compatibility: Should work across all supported platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
3. Security: No additional security risks introduced by keybinding implementation
4. Usability: Should not interfere with existing keyboard shortcuts

## Success Criteria
1. 80% of vim users report improved efficiency in alias selection
2. 100% of existing functionality remains accessible with new keybindings
3. No performance degradation in alias selection interface
4. User testing shows 50% reduction in time to select an alias

## Constraints & Assumptions
1. Technical: Must integrate with existing terminal UI framework
2. Scope: Limited to alias selection interface only
3. Keys: Only j, k, e, q keys supported for vim navigation
4. Timeline: Implementation should not exceed 3 days
5. Resource: Limited to current development team
6. Assumption: Users are familiar with basic vim keybindings

## Out of Scope
1. Full vim emulation throughout the application
2. Configuration editing keybindings
3. Advanced vim commands or navigation
4. Custom keybinding configuration
5. Support for additional vim keys beyond j, k, e, q
6. Visual mode or insert mode
7. Text editing commands
8. Search functionality with / and ? keys
9. h/l key support

## Dependencies
1. Internal: Crossterm library for terminal handling
2. External: None
3. Team: UI/UX team for keybinding design review
